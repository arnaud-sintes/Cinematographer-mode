# Cinematographer mode

## 1. Purpose

*Cinematographer mode* is a [Magic Lantern](https://magiclantern.fm/) **module** helping to solve the following situations:

- We cannot use an external *focus puller monitor* because we're recording videos using **crop modes**, which are currently incompatible with the camera *HDMI output*
- We're recording videos as a **single camera operator** without the assistance of a *focus puller* and the sequence is too complex to deal with *manual focusing*

üëâ *Cinematographer mode* provides then a way to easily **record multiple lens focus points**, so we can prepare a sequence including camera or target movements and subsequently **replay** them as we're recording videos, using a simple push button to switch to a point to the next one in the sequence.

> **Typical use case**: I'm a *single camera operator* recording a video using *crop modes* and my sequence is a combination of a *dolly-in* movement (with a speed ramp) and a horizontal camera rotation used to keep an object at the center of the composition.
>
> üëâ While I'm rehearsing the camera track and movements, I'll record three or four intermediate focus points in a sequence with proper speed transition settings, so my targeted object is always perfectly focused and I'll replay the focus sequence while I'm finally recording the scene, going forward from a focus point to the next one by pushing a single button.

## 2. How to build ?

If we want to build the module ourselves, we basically need to follow [these instructions](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=20214.0) if we're under the **Windows 10** operating system, relying over [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).

We need first to [install a Linux subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install), which can be done running the following command under *PowerShell*:

```bash
wsl --install
```

The first time, we will have to register some credentials and reboot.

To configure the ***Magic Lantern* build environment**, we will have to execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make gcc gcc-arm-none-eabi mercurial gcc-mingw-w64 python3-docutils zip
sudo apt-get install python2
```

Then we have to *clone* a ***Magic Lantern* repository**, for example [the one maintained by Danne](https://bitbucket.org/Dannephoto/magic-lantern_dannephoto_git/src/master/) containing the code base of the ***crop_rec_4k_mlv_snd_isogain_1x3_presets*** fork of *Magic Lantern*:

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/Dannephoto/magic-lantern_dannephoto_git.git
```

To add and build the *cinematographer mode* **module**, we basically need to follow [these instructions](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=19232.0), which can be summarized with the following command sequence:

- Adding a "*cinemato*" module folder with one header and one source files:

```bash
cd magic-lantern_dannephoto_git/modules/
mkdir cinemato
cd cinemato
touch cinemato.c
touch module_strings.h
```

- Copying and altering a *Makefile* from an existing module:

```bash
cp ../ettr/Makefile .
sed -i "s/ettr/cinemato/" Makefile
```

Now we just have to replace both "***cinemato.c***" and "***module_strings.h***" file content with the one provided in the */cinemato/* folder of this *git* repository, then build the module using the following command line:

```bash
make
```

If all the planets are well aligned, we must see a "***cinemato.mo***" module file appears in the folder.

## 3. How to install ?

We can use the pre-built "***cinemato.mo***" module provided in the */cinemato/* folder of this *git* repository.

> ‚ö† Please note this module was currently only tested on a ***Canon 5D mark 3*** camera with ***1.1.3*** firmware (*5D3.113* target).

To install the module:

- Copy the "***cinemato.mo***" module file to the **camera SD card** in the ***/ML/modules/*** folder
- Start the camera and enter *Magic Lantern* menu (using the [***trashcan***] button)
- Go to the "**Modules**" menu and load ([***SET***] button) the **cinematographer** module
- Re-start the camera

We may have a new "***cinematographer***" option in the *Magic Lantern*'s **Movie** menu.

## 4. How to use ?

To use the *Cinematographer mode*, we just need to **start it** by selecting the "*cinematographer*" option in the *Magic Lantern*'s **Movie** menu.

Then, we may see the following display's **overlay** on the very left side of the screen (*100pixels from the top*):

```
[idle]
```

Which is indicating the *Cinematographer mode* is waiting to be enabled.

üëÜ In order to **enable** (or subsequently **disable**) the *Cinematographer mode*, we just need to press the [***INFO***] button.

> ‚ö† Enabling the *Cinematographer mode* will hook a lot of camera keys (like the *joystick*) so we need to think about disabling it **before** going through *Magic Lantern* menus to avoid some inconvenient situations...

When enabled we may see a new overlay content, depending of the current **focus sequence mode** (***PLAY*** by default).

üëÜ We can toggle between ***PLAY*** and ***EDIT*** modes by pressing the [***Q***] button.

### 4.1. Lens focus change

In both ***PLAY*** and ***EDIT*** *focus sequence modes*, we can use the camera *joystick* in order to change the **lens focus point**:

- üëÜ [***JOYSTICK_UP***] button will **slowly** (*step by step*) **decrease** the focus
- üëÜ [***JOYSTICK_DOWN***] button will **slowly** (*step by step*) **increase** the focus
- üëÜ [***JOYSTICK_RIGHT***] button will **quickly** (*step of 10*) **decrease** the focus
- üëÜ [***JOYSTICK_LEFT***] button will **quickly** (*step of 10*) **increase** the focus

> Using *Cinematographer mode* the lens itself must be in **autofocus mode** and we need to always take care of:
>
> - never do **manual focus** operations
> - never doing **autofocus** (*half-press shutter*, in most of the cases)
>
> In both cases, *Magic Lantern* will lose its internal relative focus step reference and focus sequencing will be fucked up.

### 4.2. Edit mode

Each time we're switching to ***EDIT*** *focus sequence mode*, the focus sequence itself is **reset** and the camera display overlay will look like this:

```
[edit] 0 < 450mm (fastest)
```

Indicating:

- The current **recorded point count** *{1}*
- The current **lens distance** (mm) *to be queued* *{2}*
- The current **transition speed** *to be queued* *{3}*

Under the form:

```
[edit] {1} < {2}mm ({3})
```

The **lens distance** indication is dynamically updated regarding our **lens focus change** operations, providing an information about the point that will be **queued next in the list**, alongside the **lens focus transition speed** that will be used to go from the previous focus point in the list to this new one.

üëÜ Use the [***SET***] button to **queue** the current *lens position* and *selected transition speed* in the **focus sequence**.

üëÜ Using the [***RATE***] button, we can cycle around **transition speed** presets to select one before queuing: possible speed values are currently ***fastest***, ***fast***, ***medium***, ***slow*** and ***slowest***, corresponding respectively to the addition of a *0ms*, *10ms*, *50ms*, *100ms* and *200ms* delay between two focus rotation steps during the focus lens transition.

### 4.3. Play mode

Each time we're switching to ***PLAY*** *focus sequence mode*, the camera display overlay will look like this:

```
[play] 3/3 200mm > 450mm (fastest)
```

Indicating:

- The current **focus index** in the sequence *{1}*
- The current **sequence length** *{2}*
- The current **lens distance** (mm) *{3}*
- The **lens distance** (mm) of the **next focus point** in the sequence *{4}*
- The **transition speed** that will be used to do the transition from current focus point to the next one *{5}*

Under the form:

```
[play] {1}/{2} {3}mm > {4}mm ({5})
```

üëÜ To run the **focus transition** between the current point in the list to the next one, we just need to press the [***SET***] button.

During the transition, the camera display the following overlay:

```
[play] 1>2 870mm (slow)
```

Indicating:

- The **source focus index** in the sequence *{1}*
- The **target focus index** in the sequence *{2}*
- The current **lens distance** (mm) *{3}* that will dynamically change during transition
- The current **transition speed** in use *{4}*

Under the form:

```
[play] {1}>{2} {3}mm ({4})
```

### 4.4. Battery saver

üëÜ One additional feature we may want to use is the [***PLAY***] button that allows to quickly toggle the **camera display on** and **off**, disabling it being a huge **battery saver**, particularly when dealing with video in **crop modes** (the *framed* display really drains the battery).

## 5. What's remaining ?

üë∑ It will be great to be able to **save on disk** the *focus sequence content* and the *current focus index* to reload it when switching off the camera (but it seems we can just save single integers for now, which make this quite complicated to achieve unless I find a way to save & load raw files by myself).
